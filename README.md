# Cloud Todo App

## Description
This project was developed during an internship program with the goal of creating a unique and easy-to-use TODO website. It's designed to stand out from your usual TODO apps by including creative and unique features.

The site offers a clean, minimalist design that is both attractive and user-friendly. It's designed to engage users and keep them coming back.

Feel free to check out the visually pleasing background and start adding your ideas, memories, and todos!

All the widgets on the site are working and ready to use. A demo API key for the weather is also included for testing purposes.

## Preview
Here's a little preview to see the site in action.

## Try it out for yourself!

Make sure you have Angular installed on your device (ideally, the latest version). To get started, clone the repository and open your terminal. Run `npm install` followed by `ng serve`. This will set up a local server at http://localhost:4200/. Any modifications to the source files will trigger an automatic reload of the application.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
