# Cloud Todo App

### Description
This solo assignment was made during an internship within the company. The task was to create a simple yet unique TODO app that differs from the native TODO apps.
My site provides a stylish, minimalistic, and appealing user-friendly interface that captures the user's attention and makes them more attached to it and interact with the page.

Take a look to admire the background and feel free to stack it up with as many ideas, memories, and todos as you want!

The widgets are fully functional, I included a demo API key for testing purposes.


## Try it out for yourself!

Have Angular installed on your machine (preferably the newest version). Clone the repository, open a terminal and run `npm install` and then `ng serve`.
This will create a local server running on `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
